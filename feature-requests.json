For example, if while blocked for one hour a host attempted to connect, the ban time would be increased to two hours, then four, then eight, and so on with permament banning being possible after some ban time threshold is met.  It would be good if the factor at which the ban time increased could be configured.  All of this might also be useful towards satisfying request 1441895.  Thanks.\r\n",

  "description": "My server has been getting attacked for two days now from someone who appears to be connecting from a certain hostname, but that hostname has no IP address:\r\n\r\n\\---- /var/log/syslog:\r\nMar 31 10:28:40 services pure-ftpd: \\(?@customer2-16-172.iplannetworks.net\\) \\[WARNING\\] Authentication failed for user \\[calvin\\]\r\n\r\n\\---- /var/log/fail2ban.log:\r\n2007-03-31 10:29:03,577 fail2ban.filter : WARNING Unable to find a corresponding IP address for customer2-16-172.iplannetworks.net\r\n\r\n\\---- netstat | grep customer2\r\ntcp       13      0 \\#\\#\\#.\\#\\#\\#.\\#\\#\\#.156:ftp       customer2-16-172.:52294 ESTABLISHED\r\ntcp       13      0 \\#\\#\\#.\\#\\#\\#.\\#\\#\\#.158:ftp       customer2-16-172.:52005 ESTABLISHED\r\n\r\n\\---- ping customer2-16-172.iplannetworks.net\r\nping: unknown host customer2-16-172.iplannetworks.net\r\n\r\nThe problem, however, is that fail2ban gets confused by this. Not only can it not ban the person, but after EVERY failed attempt, it tries to ban the person but fails, creating millions of error messages in the fail2ban logs, and working hard enough that an otherwise idle server would have system load increased by &gt;0.5 \\(not a big deal, but it might be if there were 4+ such attackers at one time\\)\r\n\r\nThe only way I've found to get around this is to find out what actual ip address is trying to connect via:\r\n\r\n\\---- netstat -n | grep :21\r\ntcp       11      0 \\#\\#\\#.\\#\\#\\#.\\#\\#\\#.156:21        190.2.16.172:60231      ESTABLISHED\r\ntcp       11      0 \\#\\#\\#.\\#\\#\\#.\\#\\#\\#.158:21     190.2.16.172:60777      ESTABLISHED\r\n\r\nSo now I know their real IP address, and to hack fail2ban into working, I can then manually replace the unknown hostname by this ip address in the log file \\(or manually add an iptables rule myself, if I were brave enough\\)\r\n\r\nI know this is an issue with my system logging the hostname instead of the ip address, but given that fail2ban tends to hammer the server with IP lookups, log processing, and spitting out unreasonable numbers of errors into the logfiles, I'm wondering if there could be some way to mitigate these effects in a future release.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great product though\\!",

  "description": "This is a useful piece of software but decent documentation is desperetly needed.  Like most gnu licensed software the biggest drawback is the lack of documentation.      It is easy to use Fail2Ban if all you want is the basic installation setup, but if you want to do much more you have to spend considerable time doing trial and error on a black box to figure it out.  The software seems to work well enough at this point that documentation is about as high a priority as a new release.\r\n\r\nThere should at least be a comprehensive reference manual from which someone could learn how to really use the software.  If I wanted to volunteer to write a proper user's manual I couldn't because I don't have a really good understanding of how to use the software.\r\n\r\nThe wiki is almost useless in terms of doing anything more than the absolute bare minimum.  For example, what determines the order in which the jails are used to create chains in iptables?  A manual will result in more widespread use of the software and more people with the knowledge to volunteer to help.\r\n",

So i wanted to ban the ip for x days just for appearing in spamhaus and trying to get into my server, but fail2ban has no way to adapt the regex in order to recognize the timestamp. I guess there are hundreds of cases where this would happen.\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that i'm not sure if the program is still being developed. I'll find out soon enough.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for creating this program, the idea behind it deserves recognition.\r\n\r\nHeishiro.",

  "description": "Currently, the default iptables-\\* actions of fail2ban always add a rule to the INPUT chain. This rule jumps to the relevant fail2ban chain which contains the actual bans, so not everything ends up in the INPUT chain, but the main entrypoint for fail2ban does.\r\n\r\nThis conflicts with my firewall, vuurmuur \\(and will probably conflict with others as well, see Debian \\#515599\\). When vuurmuur restarts, it flushes the INPUT chain, removing the fail2ban rule as well. I could fix this by restarting fail2ban as well, but I was hoping for a slightly more elegant solution.\r\n\r\nVuurmuur exposes a number of \"hooking\" chains, which are empty user defined chains which are called by Vuurmuur, but their contents are never touched. In this case, I'm interested in the PRE-VRMR-INPUT chain, which is called by Vuurmuur at the start of the INPUT chain, before any rules are processed. To make fail2ban play nicely with Vuurmuur, it should just add its rules to this chain.\r\n\r\nSo, for the actual feature request: I would like to have some easier way to change the chain that fail2ban operates on. Currently, I have to copy the iptables action I'm using and change the chain in there. Making this configurable in the default iptables-\\*.conf actions would be preferable.\r\n\r\nFor this to work, a few changes would be needed. First, every action.d/iptables\\*.conf file needs to add the following line to their \\[Init\\] section:\r\n\r\n\\# Option:  chain\r\n\\# Notes    specifies the iptables chain to which the fail2ban rules\r\n\\# should be  \r\n\\#          added\r\n\\# Values:  STRING  Default: INPUT                                              \r\nchain = INPUT\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all occurences of \"INPUT\" should be replaced with\r\n\"&lt;chain&gt;\".\r\n\r\nNow, we can change the chain used for any service by changing the\r\ncorresponding action= line in jail.conf. This is still not entirely\r\nconvenient, so it might be even better to use the approach that the\r\nDebian package takes by defining a action\\_ variable that interpolates\r\nthe needed variables.\r\n\r\nI've tried this approach for just the iptables.conf action and it works,\r\nbut I don't have time for providing a full patch.\r\n",
