  "description": "Three new actions for Fail2ban, which will submit complaints about offending IPs to:\r\n\\* DShield \\(http://www.dshield.org/\\)\r\n\\* myNetWatchman \\(http://www.mynetwatchman.com/\\)\r\n\\* the abuse or other contact e-mail address of the ISP concerned \\(found from a whois lookup\\)\r\n\r\nI've been using all 3 of these myself for a month or so with no problems on CentOS 4 and Fedora 8 with Fail2ban 0.8.2. They've also been available on my web site, http://www.gloomytrousers.co.uk/open\\_source/fail2ban.shtml . The only pre-requisites are standard commands like perl, whois, awk, wget/curl, etc.\r\n\r\nReports for DShield are buffered \\(for a configurable time/number of reports\\) then sent be e-mail in batches, as per the guidelines at http://www.dshield.org/specs.html.\r\n\r\nReports to myNetWatchman are submitted to the web service in the same way as the official mNW client.\r\n\r\nThe complaints direct to ISPs tries various patterns to find the correct abuse/complaint addresses from the whois record \\(to avoid contacting inappropriate people\\), and will use those in preference to any other addresses in the whois record if it can. Experience to date has found it's pretty good at getting the right abuse addresses without contacting every address listed in the whois record, and although a surprising number of abuse addresses bounce, and I've had plenty of responses from ISPs indicating they'll take action. It includes a log excerpt \\(with time zone indicated\\) and a configurable message, and seems to meet reporting requirements for all ISPs according to the replies I've had.\r\n\r\nEach file has some documentation and examples.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like to submit these for inclusion in a future release of Fail2ban.

  "description": "This patch adds pyinotify support to Fail2ban. It's a patch against\r\nthe FAIL2BAN-0\\_8 branch.\r\n\r\nIn particular this patch uses inotify support in preference to gamin\r\nsupport when the jail type is set to auto. This patch is in large part\r\nmotivated by the large number of SElinux problems that using gamin\r\ngives. In short, gamin was never designed to be used in the way that\r\nfail2ban tries to use it - it was designed to have a single server per\r\nUID, and targets the desktop user needs, rather than the system needs.\r\nThe gory details can be found discussed here:\r\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show\\_bug.cgi?id=437633\r\n\r\nPresently this patch favours inotify use over gamin. Longer term,\r\ngamin should probably be removed from fail2ban.",
