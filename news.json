The development of this release has taken about a year and is almost a complete rewrite from 0.6. A lot of new features have been added. Here are some of them:\r\n\r\n\\- client/server architecture\r\n\\- multithreading support\r\n\\- better configuration\r\n\\- date format autodetection\r\n\\- Gamin support\r\n\\- better documentation and website\r\n\\- support for more services\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the configuration file of Fail2ban 0.6.x is not compatible with this release. However, default configuration files should be sufficient and writing your own filters, actions and jails should be quite straightforward \\[1\\].\r\n\r\nThe official website \\[2\\] is now powered by MediaWiki. Please, do not hesitate to contribute, discuss or edit the articles.

Parts of donation will go to KDE, Gnome and The Python Software Foundation.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank everyone who contributed to this release. A \\(hopefully complete\\) list is available in README \\[5\\]. Special thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko who does a lot of work for this project.\r\n\r\n0.8.0 contains only 2 minor changes since 0.7.9.

Here are the most important things introduced in 0.8.2:\r\n\r\n\\- Added &quot;full line failregex&quot;. It is now possible to match a whole line. This should avoid deny of service attacks against fail2ban. Currently only sshd.conf uses this feature. Thanks to Yaroslav Halchenko.\r\n\r\n\\- The default socket location is now /var/run/fail2ban. Do not forget to create this directory first. Moreover, fail2ban-server create a PID file in this directory.\r\n\r\n\\- New communication server using asyncore/asynchat. Fixes some issues on Solaris.\r\n\r\n\\- Python 2.3 support. Fail2ban 0.8.2 now runs with Python 2.3.\r\n\r\n\\- New log rotation detection implementation. Much simpler and less buggy.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of other fixes and features. Please look at the ChangeLog for all the details \\[2\\].

So, with permission of Cyril, I give you.... fail2ban 0.8.4\\! \\[1\\]\n\nWe have both bugfixes AND new features to introduce. 0.8.4 is the first fail2ban release to work with Python 2.6. You will never see the infamous &quot;unexpected communication problem&quot; error message anymore \\(we hope\\). Additionally, the logging subsystem is now shutdown when it really is not needed anymore, which fixes the &quot;cannot release un-acquired lock&quot; issue. Christos Psonis assisted in fixing the maxretry/findtime rate problem \\(thank you, Christos\\!\\).\n\nOn the new-features front, we have:\n\n\\* A fail2ban-client command to manually ban a specific IP for a certain jail \\(buanzo\\).\n\\* Two new filters: lighttpd-fastcgi and php-url-fopen \\(buanzo\\).\n\\* Added actions to report abuse to ISP, DShield and myNetWatchman. Thanks to Russell Odom.\n\\* A SuSE init script that correctly handles the socket file on crash. Thanks to Detlef Reichelt.\n\\* A Nagios script to help you integrate fail2ban with Nagios. Thanks to Sebastian Mueller.\n\\* Added NetBSD ipfilter \\(ipf command\\) action. Thanks to Ed Ravin.\n\n... and much more\\!\n\nFor specific details, take a look at the ChangeLog file.\n\nThank you very much for using fail2ban. Keep those bug reports, patches and ideas coming\\!\n\nMany thanks to everyone who contributed to this release.\n\nAs always, do not forget to visit the website \\[2\\] and contribute to the documentation.\n\nYours,\nBuanzo and the Fail2ban development team\n\n\n\\[1\\] http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fail2ban/fail2ban-0.8.4.tar.bz2\n\\[2\\] http://www.fail2ban.org\n",
